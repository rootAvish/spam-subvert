## SPAM SUVERT

__RETIRED__

Public now because nothing much ever came of this, was supposed to be an atempt at subverting spam filters using Machine Learning techniques. Maybe [@evamy](https://github.com/evamy) and I will pick this up again sometime in the future.


## TODO

- [ ] Maybe complete this project sometime.
